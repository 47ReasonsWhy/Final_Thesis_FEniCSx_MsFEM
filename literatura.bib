  abstract =     {In this paper we present algorithms for an efficient implementation
                  of the Localized Orthogonal Decomposition method (LOD). The LOD is a
                  multiscale method for the numerical simulation of partial differential
                  equations with a continuum of inseparable scales. We show how the method
                  can be implemented in a fairly standard Finite Element framework and
                  discuss its realization for different types of problems, such as linear
                  elliptic problems with rough coefficients and linear eigenvalue problems.},
